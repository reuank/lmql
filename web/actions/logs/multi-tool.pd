[bubble:assistant| A: First, let's find the population of Germany and the US. We can use the wiki tool to search for the population of each country.
For Germany[_|&lt;&lt;wiki("Population of Germany")||][@wait|100]![TOOL| The demography of Germany is monitored by the Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office of Germany). According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,270,625...&gt;&gt;]
For the US, [_|&lt;&lt;wiki("Population of the United States")||][@wait|100]![TOOL| The United States had an official estimated resident population of 333,287,557 ...&gt;&gt;]
Now, let's use the calc tool to add the two populations together. The population of Germany and the US combined is [@wait|100][_c|&lt;&lt;calc("84270625 + 333287557")||]![CALC|417558182&gt;&gt;]
